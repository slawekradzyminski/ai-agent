# AI Agent Project Scope

## Project Overview
An autonomous agent built with LangChain framework, capable of performing tasks and interacting with various tools and APIs.

## Current Status
- âœ… Initial project setup complete
- âœ… DuckDuckGo search tool integration implemented and tested
- âœ… OpenAI integration implemented and tested
- âœ… Basic agent framework with async support
- ðŸš§ Command-line interface (Planned)
- ðŸš§ Additional tool integrations (Planned)

## Core Objectives
1. Create an autonomous agent using LangChain framework
2. Implement tool integration capabilities starting with DuckDuckGo search
3. Maintain modular and extensible architecture for future tool additions
4. Provide easy-to-use interfaces for interaction
5. Ensure robust error handling and logging

## Technical Stack

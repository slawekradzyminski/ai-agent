# AI Agent Project Scope

## Project Overview
An autonomous agent built with LangChain framework, capable of performing tasks and interacting with various tools and APIs.

## Current Status
- âœ… Initial project setup complete
- âœ… DuckDuckGo search tool integration implemented and tested
- âœ… OpenAI integration implemented and tested
- âœ… Basic agent framework with async support
- âœ… Command-line interface implemented
- âœ… Search functionality verified with real-world queries
- âœ… Project documentation completed with usage guide
- âœ… End-to-end tests implemented for core functionality
- âœ… HTTP request functionality implemented and tested
- ðŸš§ Additional tool integrations (Planned)

## Core Objectives
1. Create an autonomous agent using LangChain framework
2. Implement tool integration capabilities starting with DuckDuckGo search
3. Maintain modular and extensible architecture for future tool additions
